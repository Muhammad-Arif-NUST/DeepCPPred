# DeepCPPred
##DeepCPPred: a deep learning framework for discrimination of cell-penetrating peptides and their uptake efficiency.  ###Cascade deep forest uses the following dependencies: * python 3.6  * numpy * scipy * scikit-learn * gcForst gcForest is developed by Zhou et al.[1,2], which can be download from  http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/code_gcForest.ashx.
